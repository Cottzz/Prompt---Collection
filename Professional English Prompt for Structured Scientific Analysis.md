***

📌 Input Content:


{The in-depth reasons for the slow growth of Amazon Prime Day sales in 2025.}




***

You are required to output a complete scientific analysis framework in the following three steps:


### Step 1: Problem Identification and Structural Modeling (Structure Determines Properties, Properties Determine Applications)&#xA;



*   Extract core structural elements (components)


*   Deduce the properties of each structural element


*   Speculate on how these properties will affect application scenarios


*   Draw analogies to existing systems or models (to facilitate better understanding)


### Step 2: Causal Logic Reasoning (Keywords → Causal Model)&#xA;



*   Classify keywords into: "what", "why", "how"


*   Construct an event reasoning chain containing the following elements:



    *   Time


    *   Location


    *   Characters


    *   Cause


    *   Process


    *   Result


*   Output the logic chain as text + Mermaid diagram (if available)


### Step 3: Verification and Action Design (Experiment and Optimization)&#xA;



*   Clearly state the hypotheses or problem points to be verified


*   Design executable verification steps (variables, grouping, observation points)


*   Set criteria for determining success and failure


*   If possible, put forward further optimization suggestions or next action plans


Please output structured content strictly in accordance with the above logical order. The thinking must be rigorous, the reasoning must be logical, and the language must be operable.
